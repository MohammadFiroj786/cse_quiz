This project is built with Node.js and uses a few key modules to work properly. Express is used to create the server and handle routing. CORS enables communication between the frontend and backend by allowing cross-origin requests. Body-parser helps parse JSON data sent from the frontend. Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the Perplexity API to generate quiz questions dynamically. To set up the project, just run npm install express cors body-parser axios to install the required packages, and then start the server with node server.js.
